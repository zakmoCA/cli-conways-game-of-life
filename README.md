# README

This is a terminal-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in C. The [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton that simulates the life cycle of a population of cells on a two-dimensional grid, based on a set of rules.

## Rules
The rules governing the Game of Life are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

There is a particularly great youtube video which explains it from a particularly great youtuber, one of my favourites, from the channel 'Veritasium'. The video itself is regarding [Mathematics' fundamental flaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo) (word to GÃ¶del!) and is very interesting, watch from 01:05 - 03:31 of the video if you're interested.

## Getting Started
To run the Game of Life simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

Open your terminal (command-line) and enter the following:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-of-life.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory and:

`cd game-of-life`

3. Compile the program by entering the following. Keep in mind 'game' can be anything you want:

`gcc -o game main.c`

4. Run the compiled program by ow entering the following:

`./game`


The simulation will start running in your terminal and display the initial random grid and update it according to the Game of Life rules. The simulation will continue running until you stop it manually.
